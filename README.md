# Poisson Equation

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of the **Poisson Equation**. 
The notebook demonstrates how to numerically solve the Poisson equation using methods such as finite differences, and visualizes the results for better understanding.

## Features
- Numerical solution of the Poisson equation.
- Visualization of results in 2D and/or 3D.
- Reproducible and easy-to-follow implementation.
